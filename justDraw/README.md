# Just Draw 🧑‍🎨
**Point and Paint 👆**: Extend just your index finger, and start drawing across the screen! Wherever your finger goes, the line follows.

**Erase with a Fist 🤛**: Want to start fresh? Make a fist, and—poof!—your canvas clears.

**Hands Up, Take a Pause 🤚**: Extend all your fingers, and the brush takes a break, letting you pause without leaving marks.

**Customize Your Colors 🎨**: Use the color picker at the top left of the screen —just click with your mouse to switch things up!
